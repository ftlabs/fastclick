{"name":"FastClick","tagline":"Polyfill to remove click delays on browsers with touch UIs","body":"# FastClick\r\n\r\nFastClick is a simple, easy-to-use library for eliminating the 300ms delay between a physical tap and the firing of a `click` event on mobile browsers. The aim is to make your application feel less laggy and more responsive while avoiding any interference with your current logic.\r\n\r\nFastClick is developed by [FT Labs](http://labs.ft.com/), part of the Financial Times.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe library has been deployed as part of the [FT Web App](http://app.ft.com/) and is tried and tested on the following mobile browsers:\r\n\r\n* Mobile Safari on iOS 3 and upwards\r\n* Chrome on iOS 5 and upwards\r\n* Chrome on Android (ICS)\r\n* Opera Mobile 11.5 and upwards\r\n* Android Browser since Honeycomb\r\n* PlayBook OS 1 and upwards\r\n\r\nFastClick doesn't attach any listeners on desktop browsers as it is not needed. Those that have been tested are:\r\n\r\n* Safari\r\n* Chrome\r\n* Internet Explorer\r\n* Firefox\r\n* Opera\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nInclude fastclick.js in your JavaScript bundle or add it to your HTML page like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type='application/javascript' src='/path/to/fastclick.js'></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script must be loaded prior to instantiating FastClick on any element of the page.\r\n\r\nTo instantiate FastClick on the `body`, which is the recommended method of use:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwindow.addEventListener('load', function() {\r\n\tnew FastClick(document.body);\r\n}, false);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Advanced\r\n\r\nInternally, FastClick uses `document.createEvent` to fire a synthetic `click` event as soon as `touchend` is fired by the browser. It then suppresses the additional `click` event created by the browser after that. In some cases, the non-synthetic `click` event created by the browser is required, as described in the [triggering focus example](http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/focus.html).\r\n\r\nThis is where the `needsclick` class comes in. Add the class to any element that requires a non-synthetic click.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nFastClick is designed to cope with many different browser oddities. Here are some examples to illustrate this:\r\n\r\n* [basic use](http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/layer.html) showing the increase in perceived responsiveness\r\n* [triggering focus](http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/focus.html) on an input element from a `click` handler\r\n* [input element](http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/input.html) which never receives fast clicks\r\n\r\n## Google Closure Compiler\r\n\r\nFastClick supports compilation with `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS` ('advanced mode'), which should reduce its size by about 70% (60% gzipped). Note that exposure of the `FastClick` variable isn't forced therefore you must compile it along with all of your code.\r\n\r\n## Credits and collaboration\r\n\r\nThe lead developer of FastClick is [Rowan Beentje](http://twitter.com/rowanbeentje) at FT Labs.
