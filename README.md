# FastClick

FastClick is a simple, easy-to-use library for eliminating the 300ms delay between a physical tap and the firing of a `click` event on mobile browsers. The aim is to make your application feel less laggy and more responsive while avoiding any interference with your current logic.

FastClick is developed by [FT Labs](http://labs.ft.com/), part of the Financial Times.

## Compatibility

The library has been deployed as part of the [FT Web App](http://app.ft.com/) and is tried and tested on the following mobile browsers:

* Mobile Safari on iOS 3 and upwards
* Chrome on iOS 5 and upwards
* Chrome on Android (ICS)
* Opera Mobile 11.5 and upwards
* Android Browser since Honeycomb
* PlayBook OS 1 and upwards

FastClick doesn't attach any listeners on desktop browsers as it is not needed. Those that have been tested are:

* Safari
* Chrome
* Internet Explorer
* Firefox
* Opera

## Usage

Include fastclick.js in your JavaScript bundle or add it to your HTML page like this:

```html
<script type='application/javascript' src='/path/to/fastclick.js'></script>
```

The script must be loaded prior to instantiating FastClick on any element of the page.

To instantiate FastClick on the `body`, which is the recommended method of use:

```js
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
	new FastClick(document.body);
}, false);
```

### Options

Fastclick supports a second, optional, options parameter. With the following options: 

| name                   | default |  description                         |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------|-----------------|
| cssClass    | null         | css class to be added when the user touches the element |
| cssDelay          | null          | delay in ms for the css class to be added (ex: 50, 100) |

These options are useful for making the element feel more like a native one when scrolling vertically through a page.

####Example

```js
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    new FastClick(document.body, {
        cssClass: "pressed",
        cssDelay: 50
    });
}, false);
```

### Google Closure Compiler

FastClick supports compilation with `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS` ('advanced mode'), which should reduce its size by about 70% (60% gzipped). Note that exposure of the `FastClick` variable isn't forced therefore you must compile it along with all of your code.

### AMD

FastClick has AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) support. This allows it to be lazy-loaded with an AMD loader, such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/).

## Advanced

Internally, FastClick uses `document.createEvent` to fire a synthetic `click` event as soon as `touchend` is fired by the browser. It then suppresses the additional `click` event created by the browser after that. In some cases, the non-synthetic `click` event created by the browser is required, as described in the [triggering focus example](http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/focus.html).

This is where the `needsclick` class comes in. Add the class to any element that requires a non-synthetic click.

## Examples

FastClick is designed to cope with many different browser oddities. Here are some examples to illustrate this:

* [basic use](http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/layer.html) showing the increase in perceived responsiveness
* [css options use](http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/cssclass.html) showing the css class options
* [triggering focus](http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/focus.html) on an input element from a `click` handler
* [input element](http://ftlabs.github.com/fastclick/examples/input.html) which never receives fast clicks
